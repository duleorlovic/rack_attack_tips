  ### Prevent Brute-Force Login Attacks ###

  # The most common brute-force login attack is a brute-force password
  # attack where an attacker simply tries a large number of emails and
  # passwords to see if any credentials match.
  #
  # Another common method of attack is to use a swarm of computers with
  # different IPs to try brute-forcing a password for a specific account.

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by IP address
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/ip:#{req.ip}"
  throttle('logins/ip', limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/login' && req.post?
      req.ip
    end
  end

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by email param
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/email:#{normalized_email}"
  #
  # Note: This creates a problem where a malicious user could intentionally
  # throttle logins for another user and force their login requests to be
  # denied, but that's not very common and shouldn't happen to you. (Knock
  # on wood!)
  throttle('logins/email', limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/login' && req.post?
      # Normalize the email, using the same logic as your authentication process, to
      # protect against rate limit bypasses. Return the normalized email if present, nil otherwise.
      req.params['email'].to_s.downcase.gsub(/\s+/, "").presence
    end
  end

  ### Custom Throttle Response ###

  # By default, Rack::Attack returns an HTTP 429 for throttled responses,
  # which is just fine.
  #
  # If you want to return 503 so that the attacker might be fooled into
  # believing that they've successfully broken your app (or you just want to
  # customize the response), then uncomment these lines.
  # self.throttled_responder = lambda do |env|
  #  [ 503,  # status
  #    {},   # headers
  #    ['']] # body
  # end
end
